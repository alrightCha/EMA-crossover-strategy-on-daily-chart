# EMA-crossover-strategy-on-daily-chart

This is a piece of code that can be implemented within tradingview to be able to use the Api of it in order to trade bitcoin on previous dates and see how successful the Ema crossover trading strategy is. As parameters, I have chosen day-trading as it is the most convenient on longer time frames (from 2012 to now) in order to have as many trades as possible, so that the win percentage gets more precise. Although Robert Pardos has given as advice to use a risk reward 1:2 , I chose to go for no risk ratio in order to maximize gains, but in order to limit the risk, I have chosen the EMAs 20/30 on the daily chart in order to have less wrong signals before entering any trade. The starting capital I started with capital of 1 btc and the end capital after 46 trades is equal to 2.2 btc, which is a huge win over the years, as I have made both the gains of btc but also doubled it. There has been a total of 7 bad entries/exits, and 16 winning entriess/exits, which is dominating by a big margin.
