# EMA-crossover-strategy-on-daily-chart

This is a piece of code that can shows how successful the Ema crossover trading strategy is. As parameters, I have chosen day-trading as it is the most convenient on longer time frames (from 2012 to now) in order to have as many trades as possible, so that the win percentage gets more precise. Although Robert Pardos has given as advice to use a risk reward 1:2 , I chose to go for no risk ratio in order to maximize gains, but in order to limit the risk, I have chosen the EMAs 20/50 on the daily chart in order to have less wrong signals before entering any trade, as they are both quite stable EMAs, that are established on long averages. The starting capital of 100 $ lately (after 46 trades, with 39 winning ones) became by the end capital 2 Million something $, which is a huge win over the years. Since simply holding bitcoin since then would result to a huge increase (from 100$ to around 450k) by today, as bitcoin is valued at 46k, it is safe to say that the strategy is very successful as it has allowed us to accumulate btc over the years and made the win margin 4 times higher than holding.
